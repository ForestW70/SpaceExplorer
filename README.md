# SpaceExplorer
## Project Description
Space Explorer allows users to enter into a dashboard showing customizable space images and facts. The images shown initially will be tailored based on user input on an initial screen, capturing their name, date of birth, zip code, and favorite planet. Then, the application will generate a dashboard customized based on those inputs. Once the user has finished exploring, they can select to go back to the start and the experience resets. 

## User Stories

- As a user, when I enter my name, the application renders on the dashboard page.
- As a user, when I enter my birthday, the application renders my astrological sign as an image with a link to a Wiki page for more information. 
- As a user, when I enter my birthday, the application renders a photo from the Mars Rover from that MM/DD/2020. 
- As a user, when I enter my zip code, the application renders the weather in my area.
